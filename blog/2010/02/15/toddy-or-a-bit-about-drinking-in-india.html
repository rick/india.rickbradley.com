        <hr />
        <p>Thought I'd fill you in on the north Kerala drinking experience, such as it is.  After all, if we're going to take a 5 1/2 month trip to India and only write a handful of posts about it, one of them might as well be about booze.</p>
        
        <p>So, various places in India have 0 legal drinking.  Gujarat, where we
        stayed for a month is one of those places.  There are coolers in the
        restaurants (like what you'd find juices in in a coffee shop in the
        US, say by the register) with, of course, juices, and some soft drinks
        (like Coca-Cola, e.g.) in them.  Then the bottom 1/3rd will have
        things that look very much like malt liquor or alcoholic beverages:
        big "40" or 22oz. looking bottles, big labels with big type, maybe
        really dark glass, etc.  The names will be things like "9pm", "5500",
        "Strong" or whatever.  But they're all non-alcoholic.  Some of them
        even go so far as to say things like (tiny print) "not" (huge print)
        "ALCOHOLIC" (tiny print) "at all", to give the impression from a
        distance that one might be drinking booze.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rickbradley/4238673169/in/set-72157622393701396/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2695/4238673169_f9c8e0aa26.jpg"></a></p>
        
        <p>That's one end of the spectrum.  Somehow there there is a way to get
        booze, either via some "permit" process I have never remotely
        understood (and I continue to persist in blaming the British for all
        Byzantine administrative bureaucracies extant in the former Raj), or
        presumably smuggled across the border from a neighboring state (such
        as Rajasthan, home of the infamous "Godfather" beer; Maharastra
        (Mumbai), etc.).  The kids down the road from Kukma village where we
        were staying on New Year's Eve were so schlitzed they started
        screaming at 11:45 and didn't let up until 2:30am.  Good times.  Even
        the burgeoning population of cur dogs shut up and cowered down for
        that one.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rickbradley/3951820851/in/set-72157622393701396/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3446/3951820851_2c955db07d_d.jpg"></a></p>
        
        <p>Much of India subscribes to the "it ain't forbidden but we're trying
        to pretend like we don't have a problem" philosophy.  Hooch is not
        available in restaurants, but rather only through barred-windows /
        big-metal doored liquor stalls.  You don't walk in, you walk up to the
        front, and they get it for you.  None of this browsing in the ails
        bidness.  It's big guys at the window, and seedy guys milling about on
        the sidewalk.</p>
        
        <p>Which also means that at dusk in such a locale you're likely to find
        some rode-hard-and-put-away-wet mean looking hobo (or saddhi, aka
        purported Indian holy-man wearing orange so you know he's not just a
        homebum) fuckers staggering and strung out, distributed in a Gaussian
        from these alcoholic medians.  Berinag, up in Uttarakhand, was just
        another piss-smelling concrete-shacked mountain village with a serious
        litter problem during the day, but come 5:30pm you'd better get your
        gingham-totin' wife back on the stage coach before she got a grope and
        a chaw-stain from the local outlaws (reader is invited to apply all
        relevant cultural translations at his leisure).  We meandered back in
        the evening a few times and the transformation was distinct once they
        let the drunks loose.  It strikes me as odd now that they didn't ring
        a five-minute warning bell.</p>
        
        <p>But, just like no state in India has a problem with litter -- while in
        reality the US litter peak in the mid-70s, before the proliferation of
        single-teared (ahem) Indian ads and "adopt-a-highway"
        advertising-cum-altruism (did I mention they use the X-cum-Y
        construction a lot here?) campaigns was a bio-degradable big mac
        container, quickly picked up from the roadside brush of life, in
        comparison to the vast fields, gulleys, and hillsides of
        half-incinerated-and-urine-doused plastic refuse smearing the
        subcontinent -- so does no state in India have a drinking problem.
        Which of course makes things 5 times worse and infinitely more
        interesting.</p>
        
        <p>Where it really gets good, however, is at the other end of the
        spectrum, where India's contact with "the West", and its desire, nay,
        need, to pander to the international tourist market produces such
        extravagances as Indian-interpreted multi-cuisine shacks, Givson
        guitar dealers, western-toilet-populated beach huts, and, lo and
        behold, sales of beer and other alcoholic beverages in bars and even
        restaurants.</p>

        <p>Goa is, without a doubt, the endpoint of the spectrum:  Anjuna beach
        is arguably the birthing ground of Goa trance (still eking out the
        occasional rave), every restaurant worth its salt in Calungate or Baga
        has a variety of Kingfisher products on ice, and the main drag has a
        number of bars with all the rip-offs and inconveniences you'd find in
        upper-end Mumbai.  But, even here, some places will serve your beer in
        a teapot; or you will find your waiter coming around to put your
        Kingfisher bottle on the floor so it's not visible from a distance.
        No matter how many bikinis (an utter scandal in 98% of India) are
        walking the beach, no matter what % of the nightly take is from the
        booze trade, it's arguably still not legal by the letter of the law,
        and the police in Goa, like anywhere else over here, don't miss a good
        opportunity for a shakedown.</p>
        
        <p>But, Kovalam beach in Trivandrum, Pondicherry (up until
        post-independence still a French colony, now its own oddball "Union
        Territory" rather than part of Tamil Nadu, though sometimes good luck
        getting a beer in a restaurant, due to observance of "Tamil holiday")
        / Auroville (think hippie time-capsule from the late 60s replete with
        massive bucky-ball containing the world's largest crystal), the
        outskirts of Dharamsala, and islands of expats from Bangalore to
        Mumbai to Delhi, they all have bubbles of varying strength containing
        western debauchery in the sea of Indian traditionalism (whatever that
        is, uniform only in its variety).</p>
        
        <p> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vypin">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vypin</a></p>
        
        <p>Fort Cochin, just outside of Ernakulam, is another small little
        tourist enclave, pretty busy, lots of white folks.  Just north of
        that, a 10-minute ($0.04 per person) ferry ride away is Vypeen Island,
        mistakenly designated on its wikipedia page as having the highest
        population density of any island in the world (that would supposedly
        include consideration of Taiwan, Manhattan, etc. -- it's always fun to
        find a wikipedia error in the wild).  Another $0.10 will get you an
        hour-long bus ride where you can have a 60-year-old Indian man sleep
        on you while being thankful you have a rather huge backpack in your
        lap instead being defenseless, without even the pidgin Malayalam
        necessary to excuse yourself and your new paramour; ultimately ending
        up at Cherai, just a few miles walk from Cherai Beach.  Somehow even
        when the most-carried Indian travel guide in the Western world (Lonely
        Planet) says it's "one of the best kept secrets [yada yada]" it has
        still managed to be an underpopulated and quiet experience here.
        Beautiful, nearly empty beaches, clean air (finally curing what I
        presumed was an intractable case of bronchitis, tuberculosis, and a
        touch of dropsy), and a distinct lack of people trying to hijack you
        to their "cousin"'s "spice shop"/"tailor shop"/"gift shop".</p>
        
        <p>Here they have a couple of "beer parlours" which seem to be deserted
        (perhaps defunct), a number of restaurants sporting Kingfisher
        paraphernalia, and at least one place designated as a "toddy parlour".</p>
        
        <p>We sampled the fare at some of the Kingfishered restaurants.  These
        are under-the-radar joints:  the beer is not on the menu, you can
        order it and it will usually appear, but not without some risk.  The
        first night we were at one of these places it wasn't clear that beer
        was on the menu.  We noticed an older British couple getting a very
        large Kingfisher and I began to toy with the idea (one of the major
        downsides being that it is only Kingfisher, after all -- imagine
        getting worked up over a Corona, but a Corona without that hint of
        Mexico (sweat?), and sans limes) of perhaps ordering one myself.
        Shortly thereafter the waiter breezed through and hijacked the beer,
        with ensuing confusion and consternation.  Some rumblings soon after
        to the effect that "the S.S. is making rounds", and maybe 45 minutes
        later, on our way out, "the S. S." (about six 40- to 50-ish Indian men
        with tucked in shirts clearly looking for a bit of the graft)
        themselves busted into the place and were seen looking behind
        buildings, etc.  On walking outside we realized they'd even brought a
        paddy wagon along, with enough room to haul off 30-40 people (granted,
        the design was for about a dozen captives, but folks travel
        differently over here).</p>
        
        <p>But, the toddy parlour was pretty open about their wares, and one must
        presume that the S.S. justifies its crusade in the name of the
        downtrodden -- i.e., those who have bothered to cough up in advance
        the loot and favors necessary to secure an actual legal license to
        sell whatever it is that they're selling.  Ali, in a move so outside
        her normal mien as to prompt later note, was hell-bent on "us"
        partaking of some "toddy".</p>
        
        <p> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_wine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_wine</a></p>
        
        <p>As the internet will tell you, "toddy" here is a palm wine.  The shit
        ferments to high gumption in a matter of <em>hours</em>.  There are palms
        everywhere here.  Regulating the brewing of toddy is an
        incomprehensibility here in India, a country where every law on the
        books is open by all parties to interpretation, the most strict
        enforcement amounts to a negotiation, and the court system is
        fundamentally useless.  That's not to say the government (those with
        an incentive, presumably, to carve out some take from the regulatory
        coffer) hasn't tried various tacks in the past.  But, ultimately,
        they've limited themselves to licensing "parlours", restricting
        transit of the hooch over state borders, and letting some folks set up
        as legitimate "brewers".</p>
        
        <p>Of course, palm wine seems to be "brewed" about as much as prison wine
        is.  I can only presume that the incorporated breweries are most
        concerned with getting the fermentation process to halt prior to
        producing a thick mealy vinegar or, seemingly more likely, sulfuric
        acid, than they are with attaining a hoppy finish or a subtle "mouth
        feel".  The only secondary considerations are making sure the bottles
        don't explode and that the labels point back to their coffers and not
        someone else's.</p>
        
        <p>All this being said, yesterday, noon-ish (because noon is always a
        good time for some drinking), we hiked it down the road in 85+ degree
        high humidity heat (because drinking when it's hot is also not a bad
        idea) about a mile or so to our local "toddy parlour".  The sign faces
        town, not out in the boondocks where we're staying, because we need
        the kids to support the regulars, obviously (in fact, I'm pretty sure,
        having thumbed through a copy briefly at the now-defunct Shirley
        Street Station, that this is in the international franchising manual
        for dive bars).  Walking down the drive you reach what looks like yet
        another (though longish) concrete house, and we for a moment wondered
        if this joint was shuttered like many of the rest.  Seeing a few
        plastic tables in the unlit interior I decided this is probably the
        place and went in.  The saloon metaphors from earlier in the tale
        should come to mind again:  dank, dirty, dark; swarthy men, not
        particularly pleased, hands mucking about in small plates of something
        unidentifiable, "getting the job done" -- the job being to soothe the
        slow burn of not having whatever it was they were pouring over the
        burning parts.</p>
        
        <p>The proprietor, of sorts, came out of the kitchen after some noises
        from a patron, and, seeing that we didn't fall into the swarthy (much
        less 100% male) nor domestic category, ushered us outside to a
        concrete hut with more light and a larger table (and presumably fewer
        potential international diplomatic concerns).  After some negotiation
        it was revealed that our vegetarian options are fish, prawns, some
        other fish, and maybe tapioca (???), which I presumed actually meant
        "tilapia" though I haven't encountered tilapia on a menu in 6 months.
        We ordered the tilapioca and a bottle of toddy.</p>
        
        <p>We got a plate with a fish on it, a plate with manioc on it, and a
        big-ass bottle purporting to be "Sand Piper" "beer", at some elevated
        alcohol %age.  From a cursory inspection it was obvious that (a) the
        liquid inside was potent, (b) homemade, and (c) put in this bottle as
        a handy carrying and dispensing device, but without any connection to
        the provenance labeled.</p>
        
        <p>A slight ruckus outside keyed us in to the fact that 3 of the patrons
        of the big house were ambling towards the main road.  One of them was
        dialing in his walk to a setting somewhere between "no sidewards
        stability" and "possessed of the inclination to take a few dance-ish
        motivated back-steps with every 4 or 5 front-steps".  He adjusted his
        ballast by urinating on the concrete wall along the driveway, and then
        proceeded to amble at a more respectable "dedicated stumble" down the
        road.</p>
        
        <p>Ali jumped on the fish plate with relish, helped herself heartily to
        the toddy, and even found herself trying to take pictures of the
        interesting rat climbing in the corner of our shack (the combination
        of which evoked a word of surprise from me and a positive appraisal of
        the palm wine).  The wine itself was hearty:  it was a white-ish
        color, filled with a silt of the yeasts at work in its production.
        The taste was very much akin to a home-made ginger beer, but with a
        very strong kick and none of the "heat" of ginger.  I'd give the taste
        maybe a 6 out of 10 -- which is a great score from me for a
        bucket-"brewed" 3rd world concoction without hops.  Trying to estimate
        the alcohol content I'd put it at 10% perhaps up to 13% or 14% --
        definitely a kick.  The bottle was 650ml, so about a 22oz. beer size.
        Upon standing I had a minor sway happening, and we were acting a bit
        shitty for the next 90 minutes or so.</p>
