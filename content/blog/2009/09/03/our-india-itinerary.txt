<em>Ah, the moment you have all been holding your breath for -- the long-anticipated second blog post.  Not just any second blog post, but one with dates and times and facts and figures!  And maps!  And a certain small amount of sassiness.</em>  

h2. Our intinerary

We're going to India!  And since we have an idea of when we'll be where, we'd like to let you know too. (*)

We're there a couple of days, shaking off <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eqCBCUawKY">Long Island culture shock</a> and exchanging it for a whole different kettle of curried fish.

* <b>mid-September - mid-November</b>: Tripuradevi and environs, Uttarakhand.  We'll be staying and working at <a href="http://www.avani-kumaon.org/">Avani</a>.  More on these folks very soon.

* <b>mid-November - ??</b>: Bhuj and environs, Gujarat.  We'll be staying and working at <a href="http://www.kala-raksha.org/">Kala Raksha</a>.  More on these guys later, too!  We'll likely stop in Delhi on our way to Kala Raksha.

* <b>January - mid-Febrary</b>: We'll be travelling around to different spots, including <b>Bodhgaya, Bihar</b>, <b>Darjeeling, West Bengal</b>, <b>Chennai and Auroraville, Tamil Nadu</b>, and wherever else we can get to!  Send us suggestions, we love 'em.



(*) Management does not warrant dates, times, facts, figures, maps, or sass.  Management not responsible for any dragons encountered during voyages into uncharted territories.  Dates may or may not be double, dutch, blind, or mejdool; time heals all wounds, is thankfully on our side, and keeps on slippin' (slippin') into the future.  Figures, particularly girlish ones, are likely to deteriorate into something more stocky and middle-aged. All facts liable to change without notice to unfounded opinions, unsubstantiated rumor, lies, damn lies, and/or statistics.  Sass is not exchangeable for true wit, wisdom, or even smart talk.
